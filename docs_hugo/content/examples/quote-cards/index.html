In brief, it is a sensible fit of that harmony which intellectually sounds in the ears of God."</p>

   <p class="mb-0 mt-2 font-italic">"Why do we live on through this wretched life which only devours us and serves to turn us into corpses? The clocks in the Stuttgart belfries strike the midnight hour. Oh how many people have become corpses at this moment! Parents have been torn from their children, children from their parents - how many plans have come to nothing, how much sorrow has sprung from these depths and how much relief!… Virtue and vice have come in the end to the same thing! It seems that to die is man’s finest action - and what might be his worst? To be born, since that is the exact opposite of his best deed. It is therefore right of me to be angry that I was ever born into this world! Why was I not prevented from remaining in a world where I am utterly useless? What good can my existence bring to anyone?"</p>
